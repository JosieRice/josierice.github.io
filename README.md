# Web Developer Personal Site

forked from => https://locrian24.github.io

Used as an excuse to use Semantic UI and promote myself as a developer.

TODO:

- better code highlighting theme
- toggle between views of skills (different breakdowns), and make wordcloud larger
- better typography for about me section
- disable contact me button when form is open
